# My Vim config file
Designed to make my vim config portable to any linux or WSL machine with minimal work.

## Installation
First, make sure you have all the required dependencies.
```
apt install build-essential cmake vim-nox python3-dev
```
Then, clone into /tmp or another unimportant folder and run install.sh. Install script may have to be run twice and will partially fail if vim version is too old.
